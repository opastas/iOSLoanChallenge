Loan Detail

1. Define requirements - Made asumptions (If there is any business inputs or UI/UX designer for drawing-styles-etc it should be clarified before started dev phase)
 a. Main Menu screen - More options - Menu Loan Details (Data fetched when App is starting)
 b. Loan Detail screen - Data from first screen is sent to detail screen- only first option in this case will lead to second screen. From this screen user could go back to main menu
 c. Payment Detail Screen - From second screen, data fetched is being sent to this screen. From this point, user could go back, either to main screen (using navBar on top of the screen) or Loan Detail Screen (back arrow icon)
